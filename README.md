### About Me

I enjoy programming mobile applications. I developed a mobile app for doctors to streamline their work with text in their offices. Additionally, I created a REST API project during my time at university.

I am passionate about modern technologies and continuously learn new methodologies. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence and frequently use tools like GitHub Copilot and other language models.

In my free time, I love playing sports, especially football, which I've been playing for 12 years.
